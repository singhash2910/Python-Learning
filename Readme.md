# 🐍 Python Scripts for Data Analysis Learning Journey

## 🎯 Goal & Focus
This repository documents my structured learning path to master Python for modern data analysis. The goal is to move beyond scripting toward professional, scalable, and reproducible analysis.

- **Primary Focus:** Building skills in **reproducible ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and data visualization.
- **Current Status:** Actively learning core Python control flow, functions, and the Pandas library.
